This project aims to offer insightful analysis of a large dataset of fashion goods from a leading e-commerce platform in India. Product categories, brands, price patterns, and client attitudes are important areas of emphasis.

# Tools/Techniques Used:
Programming Languages: Python (libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics, data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Text Analysis: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, TF-IDF vectorization, Naive Bayes classification
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

# Approaches :
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Product Categories and Brands: Identified popular categories and top-performing brands.
Pricing and Discounts: Analyzed pricing trends and discount strategies.
Average Ratings: Explored the distribution of average ratings.

# Text Classification :
Problem: Predicted whether a product is out of stock based on its description.
Approach: Utilized TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier.
Results: Achieved accuracy and generated insightful classification reports.

# Text Analysis:
Word Clouds: Visualized positive and negative sentiments in product descriptions.
Word Frequency Analysis: Identified the top 20 words by frequency in product descriptions.

# Insights Found :

The use of discounts has a significant influence on consumer behavior.
Customers appear to be inclined to purchase more when there are large discounts.
Sellers that provide substantial discounts are entitled to substantially higher ratings.

Text Classification:
Insight: #Text was vectorized using TF_IDF vectorization, and text categorization was done using Naive Bayes.
#As a model, the accuracy score of 0.95 is good. 
#made a word cloud for text searches for in-stock and out-of-stock products.

Text Analysis:
Insight: The terms "shirt," "cotton," "wear," "men," "casuals," "shirts," "fit," etc. are most frequently used on the e-commerce site.
